All you need to do is,
1. Download the jar file [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) and run in your command line
2. Try to figure out how to input the commands correctly
3. Screw up and quit ğŸ™ƒ

Features:
- [ ] Add stuff
- [ ] Find stuff
- [ ] Delete stuff

Here is some code to give you some PTSD
```
function functional_expressionism() {
   const decrement_repeater =
	   repeater =>
		   repeater((iter_count, x) => iter_count)(zero_repeater);
}
```
